you are required to build a product landing page with a professional and highly structured layout. This page should follow the visual structure and behavior of the reference images provided. The layout must be fully responsive, clean, and built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî no frameworks like React, Vue, or libraries like jQuery.

### PURPOSE:
This is a reusable template for multiple products. Do not hardcode any real product data. All content (text, images, prices, options) must be implemented as placeholders.

---

### PAGE STRUCTURE (based on the reference images):

1. Image Display Section (Left Side):
   - A large product image is displayed prominently at the top-left.
   - Below it is a horizontal row of small thumbnail images.
   - When a thumbnail is clicked, the main image above must update accordingly (image switch behavior).
   - The image switch must be instant, smooth, and without reloading the page.
   - All images are placeholder content and must be easily swappable.

2. Product Information Section (Right Side of the images):
   - Product title (use dummy title)
   - Optional star rating (static visual only)
   - Price section:
     - Original price with strikethrough
     - Discounted price with highlighted styling
     - Percentage discount shown next to the price
   - Short description in 2‚Äì3 lines (dummy text)
   - Bullet list (5‚Äì7 lines) for product features or benefits (placeholder text)

3. Order Form (Positioned clearly beneath or beside the product):
   - Fields (use placeholder names):
     - Full Name
     - Phone Number
     - Wilaya (Dropdown menu with all 58 Algerian wilayas ‚Äì you already know them)
     - Commune (Free input field to be filled manually by the customer)
     - Quantity
   - Submit button with label like: ‚Äú‚úÖ Confirm Order Now‚Äù
   - All fields must be editable and easily changed for other products
   - Do NOT include a color selector ‚Äî this product does not require color selection

4. Responsive Behavior:
   - Desktop: product image gallery on the left, product details and form on the right
   - Mobile: elements must stack vertically, with image gallery at top, followed by info, then the form
   - Thumbnails must remain scrollable and usable on small screens

5. Telegram Bot Integration ‚Äì Dual Channel System:

   - Upon order form submission:

     ‚úÖ Telegram Channel 1 (Notification Channel): send a short alert with:
         üü¢ New Order!
     Name: {{name}}
     Total Price: {{price}} DZD
     
     üì¶ Telegram Channel 2 (Details Channel): send the full order info:
         üõí New Order Received:
     Name: {{name}}
     Phone: {{phone}}
     Wilaya / Commune: {{wilaya}} / {{commune}}
     Quantity: {{quantity}}
     Total Price: {{price}} DZD
     Order Time: {{datetime}}
     
   - The Telegram integration must be built in, with placeholder fields for Bot Token and Chat IDs.
   - The bot is assumed to have permission to post in both channels.
   - Do not display the phone number in the notification message (channel 1), only in the detailed message (channel 2).

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Use only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- Do not use any front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Vue).
- Do not use external libraries like jQuery or Bootstrap.
- The final code should be modular, clean, and clearly separated by functionality.
- Placeholder content must be easy to replace in the code for future reuse.
- All parts must be ready to plug into any static hosting environment or export as standalone HTML.
- The code must be highly organized and clearly structured to allow easy future modifications such as:
  - Adding or removing images
  - Changing text, price, colors
  - Adjusting layout
  - Updating Telegram bot credentials
  - Replacing form fields
